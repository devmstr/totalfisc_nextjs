# **The Definitive Guide to the Algerian Financial Accounting System (SCF): Exhaustive Nomenclature, Statutory Coding, and Functional Analysis**

## **Executive Summary**

The modernization of the Algerian economy, driven by the necessity to integrate into the global financial architecture, mandated a fundamental restructuring of its accounting language. The promulgation of **Law No. 07-11 of November 25, 2007**, established the **Système Comptable Financier (SCF)**, replacing the obsolescent National Accounting Plan (PCN) of 1975\. This shift was not merely a change in coding but a transition from a tax-centric, patrimonial model to an investor-centric framework grounded in economic reality and aligned with International Financial Reporting Standards (IAS/IFRS).  
This report provides an exhaustive technical reference for the SCF nomenclature across all seven mandatory classes. It is engineered to serve as a definitive manual for financial professionals, auditors, and systems architects. Grounded in the authoritative text of the **Executive Decree No. 08-156** and the **Order of July 26, 2008**, which dictates the official chart of accounts , this document dissects the coding architecture, valuation principles, and operational mechanics of the Algerian accounting system.  
The core of this report is the comprehensive tabulation of the SCF nomenclature—presented as structured datasets designed to replicate the utility of "Excel sheets"—accompanied by deep analytical commentary on the functioning of critical accounts, legal compliance, and the divergence from previous systems.

## **Part I: The Regulatory and Conceptual Architecture**

### **1.1 The Legal Hierarchy of the SCF**

The nomenclature detailed in this report is a statutory requirement derived from a strict hierarchy of legal texts. Understanding this hierarchy is essential for compliance, as the authority of an account code rests on its legislative source.

* **The Legislative Tier (Law No. 07-11):** Enacted on November 25, 2007, this law defines the scope of the SCF, making it mandatory for all entities (excluding very small entities eligible for simplified accounting) to prepare financial statements that provide a "faithful image" (image fidèle) of their financial position. It establishes the primacy of economic substance over legal form, a radical departure from the PCN.  
* **The Executive Tier (Decree No. 08-156):** Dated May 26, 2008, this decree operationalizes the law, setting the parameters for the presentation of financial statements and the framework for consolidation.  
* **The Regulatory Tier (Order of July 26, 2008):** Issued by the Ministry of Finance, this text is the "Bible" of the SCF. **Annex 1** of this Order contains the official nomenclature and the specific rules of valuation and bookkeeping. The codes presented in this report are directly extracted from this regulatory source.

### **1.2 The Logic of Decimal Codification**

The SCF employs a decimal codification system designed for infinite expansibility, facilitating analytical accounting without breaking the statutory framework.

* **Classes (1 Digit):** The highest level of aggregation. Classes 1 to 5 form the Balance Sheet (Comptes de Bilan), while Classes 6 and 7 form the Income Statement (Comptes de Gestion).  
* **Principal Accounts (2 Digits):** The level at which the Balance Sheet and Income Statement are typically presented.  
* **Divisionary Accounts (3 Digits):** The fundamental unit of the General Ledger. The Order of July 26, 2008, standardizes codes primarily at this level.  
* **Sub-Accounts (4+ Digits):** Entities are explicitly authorized to subdivide these accounts to meet their internal management needs (e.g., distinguishing between local and foreign suppliers under Account 401).

### **1.3 Scope and Applicability**

The nomenclature applies to all economic entities dealing with goods and services in Algeria. While specific sectors like banking and insurance have specialized adaptations (e.g., the Banking Chart of Accounts defined by Bank of Algeria regulations ), the core SCF remains the backbone for the vast majority of commercial enterprises.

## **Part II: Class 1 – Equity and Non-Current Liabilities (Comptes de Capitaux)**

### **2.1 Functional Overview**

Class 1 represents the durable resources of the entity. It aggregates funds provided by shareholders (Equity), profits retained within the company (Reserves and Retained Earnings), and external debts with a maturity exceeding 12 months (Non-Current Liabilities).  
A critical conceptual shift in the SCF is the classification of liabilities based on *maturity* and *nature* rather than just the identity of the creditor. Under the old PCN, long-term debts were often intermingled with current liabilities. The SCF strictly separates "Non-Current Liabilities" (Class 1\) from "Current Liabilities" (Class 4 and 5), aligning with the IFRS distinction between current and non-current items.

### **2.2 Comprehensive Nomenclature: Class 1**

The following table presents the exhaustive list of Class 1 accounts as authorized by the Ministry of Finance.

### **2.3 Deep Dive: Critical Functional Insights**

**2.3.1 The Treatment of Investment Subsidies (Account 131\)** In the SCF, investment subsidies are considered "Deferred Income." Unlike the PCN where they might have been treated differently, the SCF mandates that these subsidies be recognized in the Income Statement (Account 754\) on a systematic basis over the useful life of the asset they financed.

* *Entry:* Debit 512 (Bank) / Credit 131 (Subvention).  
* *Amortization:* Debit 131 / Credit 754 (Quote-part de subvention virée au résultat) annually, matching the depreciation of the subsidized asset.

**2.3.2 Financial Leasing (Leasing) – Account 167** The introduction of Account 167 is one of the most significant divergences from the old tax-based accounting. Under the "Substance Over Form" principle, a finance lease (Crédit-Bail) is treated as an acquisition of an asset financed by a loan.

* *Recognition:* The entity records the asset in Class 2 (e.g., 218\) and a corresponding liability in **167** (Dettes sur contrat de location-financement).  
* *Payments:* Lease payments are split between the repayment of the principal (debit 167\) and interest expense (debit 661), rather than booking the entire payment as a rental expense (613) as was done in the PCN.

**2.3.3 Deferred Taxes (Accounts 133/134)** The SCF acknowledges timing differences between accounting profit and taxable profit.

* **Account 133 (Deferred Tax Asset):** Recognized when expenses are recorded in accounting but are deductible for tax purposes only in future periods (e.g., retirement provisions).  
* **Account 134 (Deferred Tax Liability):** Recognized when income is accrued in accounting but taxed in future periods, or when tax depreciation is accelerated compared to accounting depreciation.

## **Part III: Class 2 – Non-Current Assets (Comptes d'Immobilisations)**

### **3.1 Functional Overview**

Class 2 records assets intended for long-term use (more than one operating cycle). It includes Intangible Assets, Tangible Assets (Property, Plant, and Equipment), and Financial Assets.  
**Valuation Principles:**

* **Initial Recognition:** At acquisition cost (purchase price \+ directly attributable costs) or production cost.  
* **Subsequent Measurement:** The SCF allows two models:  
  1. **Cost Model:** Cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.  
  2. **Revaluation Model:** Fair value at the date of revaluation less subsequent depreciation. If selected, this must be applied to the entire class of assets and performed regularly.

### **3.2 Comprehensive Nomenclature: Class 2**

The official list of Class 2 accounts is detailed below.

| Code | Account Label (Intitulé du Compte) | Category | Description & Usage Notes |

### **3.3 Deep Dive: Critical Functional Insights**

**3.3.1 Research vs. Development (Account 203\)** The SCF distinguishes strictly between research costs and development costs, mirroring IAS 38\.

* **Research costs** are always expensed (Class 6).  
* **Development costs** are capitalized in Account **203** *only if* the entity can demonstrate technical feasibility, intention to complete, ability to use/sell, availability of resources, and reliable cost measurement. If these criteria are not met, they must be expensed.

**3.3.2 The Component Approach (Approche par Composants)** For tangible assets (Account 21), the SCF requires the "Component Approach." If an asset comprises significant components with different useful lives (e.g., an aircraft engine vs. the fuselage, or a building's roof vs. structure), each component must be accounted for separately under sub-accounts (e.g., 21301 Structure, 21302 Roof) and depreciated over its own specific useful life. This is a mandatory requirement often overlooked in simplified implementations.  
**3.3.3 Impairment Testing (Accounts 29\)** At each reporting date, entities must assess whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated. If Carrying Amount \> Recoverable Amount, the difference is booked as an impairment loss in Account 291 (credited) and 681 (debited).

## **Part IV: Class 3 – Stocks and Work-in-Progress (Comptes de Stocks)**

### **4.1 Functional Overview**

Class 3 includes assets held for sale in the ordinary course of business (Merchandise), in the process of production (WIP), or materials to be consumed (Raw Materials).  
**Valuation:** Stocks are measured at the lower of **Cost** (weighted average cost or FIFO) and **Net Realizable Value (NRV)**.

### **4.2 Comprehensive Nomenclature: Class 3**

The table below details the inventory accounts.

| 395 | Pertes de valeur sur stocks de produits | Impairment | Impairment on Class 35\. |

### **4.3 Deep Dive: Critical Functional Insights**

**4.3.1 The "Account 38" Mechanism** The SCF utilizes a unique flow for purchasing, distinct from some other IFRS implementations that might expense directly. Account 38 serves as a control account for the "Receipt" of goods vs. the "Receipt" of the invoice.

* *Receipt of Invoice:* Debit 38x / Credit 401 (Supplier).  
* *Physical Receipt of Goods:* Debit 30/31 / Credit 38x.  
* *Balance:* A debit balance in 38 indicates "Stock in Transit" (invoiced but not received). A credit balance is theoretically impossible in a correctly managed system but could indicate goods received without invoice (provision needed).

**4.3.2 Physical Inventory vs. Permanent Inventory** While the SCF allows for the "Intermittent Inventory" method (counting stock only at year-end), the "Permanent Inventory" method is strongly preferred for larger entities.

* In Permanent Inventory, every sale triggers two entries:  
  1. Revenue: Debit Client / Credit Sales (Class 7).  
  2. Cost: Debit COGS (600) / Credit Stock (30).  
* This allows for real-time tracking of margins.

## **Part V: Class 4 – Third Parties (Comptes de Tiers)**

### **5.1 Functional Overview**

Class 4 aggregates all receivables and payables resulting from the entity's relationships with third parties (Suppliers, Customers, Personnel, State, Associates).  
**Key distinction:** Unlike Class 1 (Non-Current), Class 4 is predominantly "Current" (due within the operating cycle or \< 12 months). However, some tax liabilities or disputed debts may linger longer.

### **5.2 Comprehensive Nomenclature: Class 4**

The following table provides the breakdown of third-party accounts.

### **5.3 Deep Dive: Critical Functional Insights**

**5.3.1 Management of VAT (Account 445\)** The SCF separates Input VAT (4456) and Output VAT (4457). At the end of the month, these are netted off.

* If 4457 \> 4456: The difference is a liability (TVA à payer) moved to a payment account.  
* If 4456 \> 4457: The difference is a tax credit (Crédit de TVA) carried forward in 4456 or a specific sub-account. Note: The account **444** serves specifically for IBS (Corporate Tax), which must be calculated based on the *fiscal* result, not the accounting result.

**5.3.2 Doubtful Debts (416 & 491\)** When a client poses a risk of non-payment, the SCF mandates a specific workflow:

1. **Reclassification:** The debt is moved from 411 to 416 (Clients douteux) at its *TTC* (inclusive of tax) value.  
2. **Impairment:** A provision is recorded in 491 for the *HT* (exclusive of tax) amount of the potential loss. The expense is booked in 685\.  
3. **VAT Recovery:** VAT on bad debts is generally not recoverable until a court judgment proves irrecoverability, at which point the loss becomes definitive (Account 654\) and the provision is reversed (Account 785).

## **Part VI: Class 5 – Financial Accounts (Comptes Financiers)**

### **6.1 Functional Overview**

Class 5 records the most liquid assets: cash, bank balances, and short-term financial instruments (Cash Equivalents).  
**Valuation:**

* **Foreign Currency:** Balances in foreign currencies must be translated at the closing exchange rate of the Central Bank of Algeria. Unrealized gains are recorded in **766** (Gains de change), and unrealized losses in **666** (Pertes de change). This is a mandatory year-end adjustment.

### **6.2 Comprehensive Nomenclature: Class 5**

The table below details the financial accounts.

| Code | Account Label (Intitulé du Compte) | Category | Description & Usage Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **50** | **Valeurs mobilières de placement (VMP)** | **Securities** | **Short-Term Investments** |

| 502 | Actions propres | Securities | Treasury shares held temporarily. |
| 503 | Autres actions ou titres (droit de propriété) | Securities | Other equities held for trading. |
| 506 | Obligations | Securities | Short-term bonds. |
| 508 | Autres VMP et créances assimilées | Securities | Money market funds, etc. |
| 509 | Versements restants à effectuer sur VMP | Securities | Unpaid portion of VMP. |

| 594 | Pertes de valeur sur régies d'avances | Impairment | Impairment of advanced funds. |

### **6.3 Deep Dive: Critical Functional Insights**

**6.3.1 Internal Transfers (Account 58\)** The **58 (Virements internes)** account is a purely transitional account used to ensure control over cash movements. It enables the decoupling of the "Issue" of a transfer and its "Receipt."

* *Step 1 (Send):* Credit Bank A (512) / Debit 58\.  
* *Step 2 (Receive):* Credit 58 / Debit Bank B (512).  
* *Control:* At any given time, the balance of 58 represents "Cash in Transit." At year-end, this must be reconciled.

**6.3.2 VMP Valuation (Account 50 vs 591\)** Marketable securities (VMP) are initially recorded at acquisition cost. At the balance sheet date, they are valued at **Fair Value** (market price).

* If Market Price \< Cost: An impairment loss is recorded in **686** (Debit) and **591** (Credit).  
* If Market Price \> Cost: The gain is generally *not* recognized until sale (Prudence Principle), unless the entity classifies them as "Trading" instruments under specific IFRS options allowed by the SCF.

## **Part VII: Class 6 – Expenses (Comptes de Charges)**

### **7.1 Functional Overview**

Class 6 records expenses by **Nature** (what the money was spent on: materials, transport, salaries), not by **Function** (R\&D, Sales, Admin). This "Nature" classification is mandatory for the statutory Income Statement. Analytical accounting (Class 9, optional) is used to reclassify these by function.

### **7.2 Comprehensive Nomenclature: Class 6**

The following table details the expense accounts.

| Code | Account Label (Intitulé du Compte) | Category | Description & Usage Notes |

### **7.3 Deep Dive: Critical Functional Insights**

**7.3.1 Account 603 (Variation des stocks)** This account is pivotal for matching costs to revenues.

* **Destocking (Inventory Decrease):** Debit 603 / Credit 31\. This increases the expense, reflecting that goods sold/consumed came from prior stock.  
* **Restocking (Inventory Increase):** Debit 31 / Credit 603\. This decreases the expense (credit balance in expenses), reflecting that purchases made this year were stored, not consumed.

**7.3.2 TAP (Taxe sur l'Activité Professionnelle) \- Account 642** TAP is a specifically Algerian tax levied on turnover (typically 1.5% to 2% depending on the sector and region). It is recorded in **642**, distinguishing it from VAT (Class 4). TAP is an expense; VAT is a balance sheet item.  
**7.3.3 Fines and Penalties (656)** While fines are recorded as accounting expenses in 656, they are **non-deductible** for the calculation of the IBS (Corporate Tax). Accountants must add these back when preparing the "Liasse Fiscale" (Tax Return).

## **Part VIII: Class 7 – Revenues (Comptes de Produits)**

### **8.1 Functional Overview**

Class 7 records revenues by **Nature**. It mirrors Class 6\.  
**Revenue Recognition:** Revenue is recognized when it is probable that future economic benefits will flow to the entity and these benefits can be measured reliably (IAS 18 principles adopted by SCF).

### **8.2 Comprehensive Nomenclature: Class 7**

The table below details the revenue accounts.

| Code | Account Label (Intitulé du Compte) | Category | Description & Usage Notes |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |

| 705 | Vente d'études | Sales | Revenue from studies. |
| 706 | Autres prestations de services | Sales | Service revenue. |
| 708 | Produits des activités annexes | Sales | Rental income (if secondary), royalties. |
| 709 | RRR accordés par l'entreprise | Sales (Dr) | Rebates granted to customers (Debit balance). |
| **72** | **Production stockée ou déstockée** | **Prod. Stock** | **Inventory Movement (Output)** |
| 723 | Variation des stocks d'en-cours | Prod. Stock | Change in WIP inventory. |
| 724 | Variation des stocks de produits | Prod. Stock | Change in Finished Goods inventory. |
| **73** | **Production immobilisée** | **Self-Constr.** | **Capitalized Production** |
| 731 | Production immobilisée d'actifs incorporels | Self-Constr. | Internal R\&D capitalized. |
| 732 | Production immobilisée d'actifs corporels | Self-Constr. | Self-constructed assets. |
| **74** | **Subventions d'exploitation** | **Subsidies** | **Operating Grants** |
| 741 | Subvention d'équilibre | Subsidies | Grant to cover losses. |
| 748 | Autres subventions d'exploitation | Subsidies | Subsidies for operating costs. |
| **75** | **Autres produits opérationnels** | **Operating** | **Misc. Income** |
| 751 | Redevances pour concessions, brevets | Operating | Royalties received. |
| 752 | Plus-values sur cession d'immobilisations | Operating | Gain on asset disposal. |

| 786 | Reprises \- Eléments financiers | Reversals | Reversal of Financial provisions (59). |
| **79** | **Transfert de charges** | **Transfer** | **Expense Reclassification** |
| 791 | Transfert de charges d'exploitation | Transfer | Neutralizing operating expenses. |
| 796 | Transfert de charges financières | Transfer | Neutralizing financial expenses. |
| 797 | Transfert de charges exceptionnelles | Transfer | Neutralizing extra expenses. |

### **8.3 Deep Dive: Critical Functional Insights**

**8.3.1 Account 72 (Variation de stocks de produits)** Unlike Account 603 (which tracks raw materials), Account 72 tracks the production of the entity.

* **Production \> Sales (Stock Increase):** Credit 72 / Debit 35\. This *increases* the result, recognizing that the entity produced value that is stored.  
* **Sales \> Production (Stock Decrease):** Debit 72 / Credit 35\. This *decreases* the result, matching the cost of the destocked items against the sales revenue.

**8.3.2 Account 79 (Transfert de charges)** This account is essential for strictly accounting purposes. It is used to:

1. **Re-invoice costs:** If the company pays insurance for a subsidiary, it books Debit 616 / Credit 401\. Then, to bill the subsidiary: Debit 451 / Credit 791\. This neutralizes the expense in the P\&L without erasing the original nature of the transaction.  
2. **Insurance Reimbursements:** Insurance payouts for damages are often credited to 791 to offset the repair costs recorded in 615\.

## **Part IX: Conclusion and Implementation**

The nomenclature provided above constitutes the statutory "Plan de Comptes" for Algerian entities under the SCF. While the 2-digit and 3-digit codes are mandatory, the 4-digit extensions shown in some functional descriptions are industry best practices derived from standard implementations in ERP systems like Odoo, SAP, and PC COMPTA.  
For the successful "Excel" implementation requested:

1. **Map** the Class 1-5 accounts to the Balance Sheet (Actif/Passif) format defined in Decree 08-156.  
2. **Map** the Class 6-7 accounts to the Income Statement (Compte de Résultat) format.  
3. **Ensure** that "Pivot" accounts like 38, 58, and 131 are configured with the correct automated clearing logic to avoid "ghost" balances at year-end.

This data structure ensures full compliance with the **Arrêté du 26 juillet 2008** and provides the granular depth required for robust financial reporting in Algeria.
